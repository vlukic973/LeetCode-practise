## Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

# A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

# Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
# Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
# Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
# Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

    def isHappy(self, n):

        seen = set()
        while n not in seen:
            seen.add(n)
            n = sum(int(i)**2 for i in str(n))
            if n == 1:
                return True
